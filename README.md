# myMarketPlace
myMarketPlace is an online marketplace designed to simplify the way we buy and sell.

# The aim of the myMarketPlace
To start with, every user can create their own account via “Sign up” page. Users can see the Recent items posted or create a “New item”. New Item page allows users to do following:
 Choose a Category
 Write the Name of the new item
 Write a description
 Determine the price
 Choose an image file
Finally, “Submit”.
After all, buyers will be able to see added items in the Recent items section or they can “Search for...” their desired item through the browser.
Users can browse their desired items also by category through the browser. Buyers can contact the seller and initiate a chat.
